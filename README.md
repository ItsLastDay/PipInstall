# PipInstall

This is a DevDays Fall 2016 project. We strive to create a classifier, which predicts whether a review for some product/service is *paid* or *not*.

## Our progress on day 1
 - we chose a [review domain](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/PipInstall/wiki/Choosing-reviews-domain) - Internet Markets;
 - we gathered dataset from Yandex.Market;
 - we evaluated our dataset (1 assessor per 1 review) and split it into paid and good categories;
 - we brainstormed machine learning features that we'll use + did some research of existing work.
Overall, our team gave solid performance on day 1.
